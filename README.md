# ToDoList Application
## Description:
This application is writen in Java and could help users to manage their to-dos. It will allow a user to create new tasks, assign them titles and due dates, and create a new project or choose an existing project for that task to belong to. The status of each new task or new project is conceptually defined as **to-do**, since new tasks and projects are created to be done. The application works using the command-line or Console window in Java. The application gives the user the possibility to sort all the tasks by their due dates or their projects. It also enables the users to edit, mark as done or remove tasks from the task list.
